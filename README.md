# What is Gravitational Asteroids?
Gravitational Asteroids is my own take on the classic arcade game, 'Asteroids'. The biggest difference
between is that a gravitational pull has been implemented between the player and all asteroids. Customization
of the player and controller support has also been added.

# Installation
`git` and `pip` are both required to install Gravitational Asteroids. To clone the repository, run the
following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/heidelbergah/Gravitational_Asteroids
```
To execute the game, simply run the `main.py` file:
```
cd Gravitational_Asteroids/
python3 main.py
```
# Controls
To navigate through the menu, use the arrow keys, and use 'enter' to select/toggle. Use W to thrust
the player, A to rotate left, D to rotate right, and the space bar to fire.
